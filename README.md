This is a simple business like lets say website with 5 pages, it has implemented all the requirements of Project0 as I will explain also below whats happening inside the files of the project. There is not much text descriptions in the page as is just having a hard implementation of required features.

File styles.css 
This is the Sass file, from top down it has first the implementation of the variable with sans serif and primary color gold.
Then next down is the implementation of the nesting feature for listed items and appearance.
Last is the inheritance feature which displays four types of messages.

File style.css
Its a stylesheet and has listed five features as required in project0, for 2 types of headers, for paragraph and #id and class features.

File home.html
This is the home page of the website, it has included the css stylesheet link, the bootstrap 4 link and a media responsive feature which changes the background color depending on the size of the screen, a demonstration of #id feature from css file, a photo inserted and last the links for the other pages of the website.

File about.html
This file includes the css stylesheet link, the bootstrap link, header and paragraph properties from css stylesheet, a card display including explanatory text and a further link at the bottom, this is optimized using bootstrap features. Last again the links to the other html pages present.

File future projects.html
